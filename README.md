## 3 - Recommendations:
1.	Enhance Oversight on High Loss Days (Thursday, Tuesday, Sunday):
It is recommended to increase oversight and implement additional preventive measures on the days with the highest loss rates, such as allocating extra staff or improving inventory monitoring processes to ensure greater effectiveness.
2.	Review and Improve Procedures During the Morning Shift:
Since the morning period records the highest loss rates, it is essential to review operational procedures and train staff on better inventory handling techniques, as well as implement additional monitoring technologies to minimize errors.
3.	Provide Special Training for Employees with the Highest Loss Rates (Bianca Țăran, Sorin Săftoiu, Radu Călinescu):
Additional training should be offered to employees with the highest loss rates to raise awareness about the importance of inventory management and reduce human errors.
4.	Review Storage and Inspection Methods for the Most Lost Items (e.g., Throw Blanket, Electric Toothbrush):
It is crucial to improve storage and inspection methods for these product categories. Consider using more accurate tracking systems, such as RFID, or optimizing storage techniques to minimize loss opportunities.
5.	Implement Advanced Technology:
Explore new technologies such as RFID tracking systems or smart surveillance cameras to enhance inventory monitoring with greater precision and effectiveness.
6.	Conduct Regular Data Analysis:
Regular inventory analyses should be performed using dashboards or automated reports to detect any emerging issues or patterns, which will help in taking swift actions to reduce losses.

## 4 - Conclusion:
We recommend implementing these recommendations to improve inventory management and reduce loss rates. The dashboard remains a vital dynamic tool for continuously updating analyses, which contributes to making informed and swift decisions to ensure the effectiveness of inventory management and achieve sustainable results.
